The 'ExtInt' project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board and demonstrating the 
use of external interrupts.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 400 MHz
   - CCLK  = 100 MHz

 - Pin P2.10 is configured to generate an external interrupt.
   Pressing button INT0 toggles LEDs.
 
The EXTI program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:  - configured for software Simulator
  MCB1700:    - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
